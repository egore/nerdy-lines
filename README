Nerdy Lines Gnome Icon Theme - 0.2.0
==============================================

About: 
----------------------------------------------
This theme is based on the Kreski Lines icon theme. The main problem was that
the original theme was not scalable. And also incomplete. That gave my desktop
an incomplete look. So I decided to fix that. The result is that they were
redrawn from scratch in SVG-format.
